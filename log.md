# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 31, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the FCC Tribute Page project

**Thoughts:** Definitely learnt a lot more about Bootstrap and just general HTML structure as well. Had some difficulties with styling but hopefully I'll get the hang of it soon!

### Day 2: August 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the FCC personal portfolio page

**Thoughts:** I'm slowly getting my head around Bootstrap and I feel way more comfortable learning from reading the docs and understanding through examples, as well as testing it out on my own web page. Looking forward to working more on this project!

### Day 3: August 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the FCC personal portfolio page

**Thoughts:** Didn't get as much time as I wanted today but I was able to implement social media links and learn a lot about plugins that extend the Bootstrap framework. I'm getting more used to Googling and finding what I need to know or use to get the result that I want as well.

### Day 4: August 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the FCC Personal Portfolio page

**Thoughts:** I spent a super long time picking colours for this webpage, and I'm not even sure I like the colour palette I picked. But I think that I'm understanding the nuances of HTML and CSS a lot more. My workflow tends to be to try something out, see how it looks and tweak until it looks right. So far it seems to be working, and I hope it continues to.

### Day 5: August 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the FCC Random Quote Machine page

**Thoughts:** First time using Ajax in a project, and whilst I had some initial struggles it felt pretty natural to use. Getting a much better grasp of how JavaScript actually affects web pages in general as well. Proud of my GoT quote machine!

### Day 6: August 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on FCC Local Weather App page

**Thoughts:** Spent a lot of time reading and a bit (my daily hour) of time coding today. Read up on APIs and how keys work, and some of it was a bit overwhelming in terms of how much I still don't know, but I feel that every time I revisit a concept a little bit later I understand it a whole lot more so I'm hoping that continues for all the things I've encountered, or am yet to encounter on my journey.

### Day 7: August 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the FCC Local Weather App page

**Thoughts:** Read up (and applied) a lot of jQuery notation. I decided not to use Bootstrap for this one just to try it out without it. It required a lot more manual CSS tweaking, but I was still able to figure it out which was great. This was the most JavaScript I've written so far but it was fairly manageable.

### Day 8: August 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Wikipedia Viewer page

**Thoughts:** Didn't get as much done today, just worked on the basic template and messed around with CSS styling. I still struggle with using CSS properly and creating nice designs on the front end, but I'm working on it.

### Day 9: August 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Wikipedia Viewer page

**Thoughts:** Finished the full functionality. Learnt a lot from messing around with Wikipedia's API, much more complex than anything I've used so far. Just the styling left for tomorrow.

### Day 10: August 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Wikipedia Viewer page

**Thoughts:** Did my final styling! I honestly feel most proud of this project so far compared to all the rest. I think it's basic in styling but it looks okay and I'm really happy about that. 10% down!

### Day 11: August 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Twitch Viewer page

**Thoughts:** Did all of the functionality and most of the styling for the page. Struggling a little bit with element positioning but otherwise it feels like this project wasn't too difficult, just some parsing of JSON and that's about it. I'm excited to go on to the advanced problems! I can imagine those being much harder but I feel like I'm ready for the challenge.

### Day 12: August 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Twitch Viewer page, Worked on JavaScript Calculator

**Thoughts:** Polished up my Twitch Viewer page, and I'm mostly happy with it. I started on the JavaScript calculator but spent a decent amount of time just messing around with how to position the buttons correctly on the calculator. The equals button height spanning two rows gave me a lot of problems but I eventually worked it out. The hard part starts tomorrow, with the actual calculator functionality, but I think I have some ideas.

### Day 13: August 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished JavaScript Calculator

**Thoughts:** Did a lot today and finished the JavaScript calculator! This took so long and I know my code is not particularly clean or easy to read, but I actually got it working pretty well! Had to clear out lots of bugs because of the calculator's functionality and just the sheer number of different edge cases. It took me a while but I'm proud of how it looks and how it works as well.

### Day 14: August 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Pomodoro Clock

**Thoughts:** I sped through the pomodoro clock exercise, almost implementing the whole functionality today! I have been looking forward to this particular project for a while because pomodoros have really increased my productivity ever since I began doing them 2 months ago. I really am feeling the increased knowledge of JavaScript from doing previous projects (especially the calculator). I think I'll be able to finish this tomorrow, way ahead of my initial expectations!

### Day 15: August 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Pomodoro Clock

**Thoughts:** This one was really fun. It wasn't too difficult to make and I feel I did a much better job of program structure than the last challenge (although, it is a bit spaghetti code-like I think). Next few days will be busy but I'll continue to push on through to the next project, Tic Tac Toe!

### Day 16: August 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Tic Tac Toe

**Thoughts:** Spent a while positioning elements to set the layout of this game. I don't feel that I used the best method for this task, but it works nonetheless. I haven't actually started to implement any of the real core of the game yet, mostly it has been styling it up to look good, and I'll be working on the functionality tomorrow. Hopefully there aren't too many problems but we'll see when I start it tomorrow.

### Day 17: August 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Tic Tac Toe

**Thoughts:** Spent some time making the functionality work. Ran into some problems but I think I'm almost at the point where two-player functionality is complete. Once that's done I'll be implementing the computer AI, which will hopefully be tomorrow.

### Day 18: August 17, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Tic Tac Toe

**Thoughts:** I'm struggling a lot with this one. Partly because I have a lot going on in my life right now but also partly because I just can't seem to figure this one out properly. I'm feeling like I'm getting nowhere and every time I try and fix one bug, another bug appears. I'll try and do this again tomorrow, but I'm tempted right now to just simply restart my JavaScript because it's really starting to look like spaghetti code and I can feel the difficulty in maintaining/extending it right now.

### Day 19: August 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Tic Tac Toe

**Thoughts:** Another struggle again. I reorganised the code a little bit so it's a bit better but I'm not doing well with all the asynchronous timers. It's really frustrating and late and I'm just not getting my best cognitive power out right now. First time I've been really stuck on a project.

### Day 20: August 19, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Tic Tac Toe

**Thoughts:** I'm 20% there! It was still a big challenge to work on this one today, but I felt way better about it. I rewrote all my JavaScript code from scratched and whilst it's not perfect I like its design way better than before. Definitely learnt a lot about my own perseverance through this challenge. I removed the 2 player option and just worked on the minimum user stories of playing against a computer only. It works, but the AI is completely random. I've marked it as finished because it works, but I might revisit this in the future to implement a perfect AI instead.

### Day 21: August 20, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Simon Game

**Thoughts:** Didn't get the chance to do a lot today. I did some work on the basic template of the Simon Game and planned out how I want to do it, but other than that I haven't done much else. Hoping to work through the layout and functionality tomorrow.

### Day 22: August 21, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Simon Game

**Thoughts:** Continued my work on the Simon Game. I only managed to finish the styling for the game, but I do think it looks pretty nice. Next step is to implement the functionality.

### Day 24: August 23, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Simon Game

**Thoughts:** I finished the Simon Game and got my Front-End Development certificate from Free Code Camp!!! I definitely didn't expect to finish this soon but I just set aside some time and smashed this one out. The functionality turned out not to be as difficult as the calculator or tic tac toe, but I did need to learn to work with asynchronous timers better than the pomodoro clock. I'm looking to learn React now that I've finished with this certificate and am really excited to see what's next!

### Day 25: August 24, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Codecademy's Learn ReactJS: Part I

**Thoughts:** Spent the day learning React. I didn't actually get to starting a project yet because I wanted to give myself a day to read the docs and familiarise myself with how to actually use React properly, and then tomorrow I plan to finish up the tutorials and begin a project. So tomorrow will be the start of my React projects.

### Day 26: August 25, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Codecademy's Learn ReactJS: Part II, Worked on Markdown Previewer

**Thoughts:** Finished up the React course and built the Markdown Previewer. All the functionality is done but I'll finish up the project tomorrow with the final styling. React seems pretty cool actually. It has been really fun, and pretty intuitive, to learn and I do like the way that it works. I am a bit confused on how to do styling properly though.

### Day 27: August 26, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Markdown Previewer, Worked on Camper Leaderboard

**Thoughts:** Finished the styling on the Markdown Previewer (which honestly was not a lot of styling at all). I feel like I had nothing really left to style for the Markdown Previewer. So I started working on the Camper Leaderboard, which I've made a basic structure for. I'm really liking React so far. I don't entirely know how to do styling properly for React apps (I'm just doing normal CSS or might start using SCSS right now). Component building is pretty intuitive though. I'm a bit confused about the Flux architecture, state management with Redux and things like that, as well as getting JSON from APIs. I guess I'll just have to keep reading and exploring to see how I can figure them all out.

### Day 28: August 27, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Camper Leaderboard

**Thoughts:** Finished all the functionality for the Camper Leaderboard. I feel like I might need to restructure my code and components a bit, I did feel some copy-pasting and I'm not following DRY strongly enough. I'll refactor tomorrow probably. But overall this was pretty intuitive. I think I am calling the API a bit too often too, I should change that up tomorrow as well. So the plan is, refactor components/API calls and do all the styling for this project to be complete by tomorrow.

### Day 29: August 28, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Camper Leaderboard

**Thoughts:** I restructured the data calls to store the data on the client side so that I don't excessively call the API. It's not the cleanest code but I think it is better to reduce API calls to once per refresh. I did some basic styling. It's not where it needs to be for the complete build but I'm getting there, didn't get that much time to work on it today. I'll finish tomorrow for the 30 day finish!

### Day 30: August 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Camper Leaderboard

**Thoughts:** Did the styling for the website. Not perfect, but I do think I've gotten a much better grasp on React and how to use it properly. I'm really loving it. Really excited for the next project.

### Day 31: August 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Recipe Box

**Thoughts:** I didn't get a lot of time to work on this today. I setup the recipe box project and that's about it. Reading the user stories made me realise I need to learn about local browser storage which is something I've been wondering about. Hopefully I get the time to learn and do all that tomorrow.

### Day 33: September 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Recipe Box

**Thoughts:** I did all the basic layout and styling for the Recipe Box. Next up is implementing the full funtionality, and then polishing the styling to look nice. I haven't had the chance to learn about local storage and think about that yet, but I will soon.

### Day 34: September 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Recipe Box

**Thoughts:** Added functionality to hide and show the ingredients. It felt like it would only be a small feature but it was actually somewhat time consuming to implement. I feel like I am grasping how to do things with a more immutable and functional programming mindset, particularly when working with React. Again, not that much time to work on it today, but tomorrow I should get the time to go all out and knock this one out.

### Day 35: September 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Recipe Box

**Thoughts:** Finished implementing a modal for adding recipes. First time working with React Bootstrap, and it's pretty intuitive and nice. I'm going to fix all the styling issues a little bit later; focusing purely on functionality first to get it all working well. It's turning out pretty well, but I'm working feature by feature, taking it slow so I can get it all done. Didn't have the chance to go all out and not sure I will be able to, but up next is modifying recipes.

### Day 36: September 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Recipe Box

**Thoughts:** I worked on deleting recipes first due to time constraints. It wasn't too hard to do but I'm starting to feel the technical debt of cramming all my state into a single component. Maybe it would have been better to spread the state out into separate smaller components. I'm not too sure at this point really, but it's functional and working, and the editing part is the last part I think. Hopefully I can get it done tomorrow and then work on styling.

### Day 37: September 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Recipe Box

**Thoughts:** Finished all the functionality in the recipe box task! Just need to polish up the styling and I'll be ready to host it and move on to the next project. This has been the most time consuming and complex of all the projects I've done so far, but I think it's a good precursor to learn how to make things that I want to make in React. My code is not clean at all and has one mammoth parent component, but I'll be looking to fix that by learning Flux and Redux for the next project. I also need to do local storage so I'll implement that tomorrow if I have the time.

### Day 38: September 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Recipe Box

**Thoughts:** Styled up the recipe box and it's almost complete, just one more day to update local storage and I'm done. Been busy with other commitments recently, which is why I've been so slow on this, but I'm excited to finish it and move on.

### Day 39: September 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Recipe Box

**Thoughts:** Did a quick and easy local storage fix. It's not particularly performant, but it'll do for an app like this where I sort of forgot about local storage. Finally done with this one!

### BREAK PERIOD

**Dates:** September 8, 2017 - September 14, 2017

**Reasoning:** I got really sick and I was in bed for many days during this week. As a result, I took a 1 week break to focus fully on recovery and am postponing all days within this period. The next day to resume the challenge will be September 15, 2017, starting again at day 40.

### Day 40: September 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Game of Life

**Thoughts:** Took it slow as I'm getting back into the swing of things. Worked on the basic template, added the components I wanted but not all of the data yet. I'm going to try and use Redux for this as well because I want to learn how to effectively manage state in React.

### Day 41: September 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Game of Life

**Thoughts:** Worked on the basic layout of the board. Had some trouble with the vertical gap spacing between the rows of the board, looking to fix that for tomorrow.

### Day 42: September 17, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Game of Life

**Thoughts:** Fixed the grid layout and implemented a colour change on click. The only thing is that it's not using Redux even though I wanted to start using Redux for this one. I'll refactor it tomorrow.

### Day 43: September 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Game of Life

**Thoughts:** Worked on generate the next generation. I added in some helper functions to make it easier to generate the next generation, but I haven't implemented or tested them properly yet.

### Day 44: September 19, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Game of Life

**Thoughts:** Added the full functionality to generate the next generation, but there appears to be a bug in my generating neighbours function. I couldn't figure it out today but I hope that when I figure it out tomorrow it will properly run.

### Day 45: September 20, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Game of Life

**Thoughts:** Fixed all the bugs and implemented all the buttons. This one was a pretty fun one to do mathematically, and it turned out very nice. It's easy to show off and it wasn't a breeze to make, but still something that felt manageable. Just need to finish up my styling and I'll be ready to move on to the next one.

### Day 46: September 21, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Game of Life

**Thoughts:** Finished the Game of Life. I really liked this one. I had some issues initially but once I ironed them out it was pretty straightforward from there, and at the same time visually appealing. The next one is a really big project, with the whole rogue-like game, so I might go on a tangent or I might just start it, we'll see from tomorrow!

### Day 47: September 22, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Roguelike

**Thoughts:** Started the Roguelike Dungeon Crawler project (hereby known as Roguelike). Honesty I'm a bit daunted by this one and how many user stories there are. I'm not entirely sure how I'm going to work out the game mechanics and make it work out well. I am going to for sure use redux for this one though, so I'll be implementing that tomorrow once I read some tutorials. Hopefully I can work this one out.

### Day 48: September 23, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Roguelike

**Thoughts:** I made some infrastructure to work with for the screen. I'm still trying to read up on Redux, but I did implement some basic structure and install the dependencies for it. Hopefully I can get something to show tomorrow and then work on the actual game mechanics.

### Day 49: September 24, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Roguelike

**Thoughts:** Didn't push to Github today, but I researched a lot about Redux and tried to modify my code to match the Redux structure. At the moment it seems simple in concept but not so simple in implementation. I think I'm still just trying to get my head around how it works, and once I do it should be easier to figure out.

### Day 50: September 25, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Roguelike

**Thoughts:** Setup the cell positioning for the screen, ready for when I create all the maps and project what I want to the screen as well. I'm still not entirely sure how I'm going to do this, especially with Redux, but it's starting to look a lot more clear than it did before. Although it is day 50, this does include my 2 missed days, so I'm going to count day 52 as the halfway mark of my 100 days challenge since that is when I have truly completed half the challenge.

### Day 51: September 26, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Roguelike

**Thoughts:** Changed up the map to be bigger than the previous map. I also adjusted the screen so that now it only displays a given portion of the map. This will make it easy to simulate movement, where I can simply change which portion of the map to show to move in a particular direction.

### Day 52: September 27, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Roguelike

**Thoughts:** Didn't have that much time today so I simply extended the map to have more rooms and added some actions that I will be using when I connect the React app to the Redux store. I'll be looking to implement Redux tomorrow. Finally at the halfway point with 50 days complete! It has been an amazing 50 days and I am looking forward to another 50 more, as I've learnt so much so far.

### Day 53: September 28, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Roguelike

**Thoughts:** Added some actions and created some reducers for state management with Redux today. Haven't gotten to a functional stage yet but I think I'm pretty close to getting there, just need to implement my container components as well and I should be able to get something working.

### Day 54: September 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Roguelike

**Thoughts:** Didn't have time to work on containers today, but I created another map so that I can test switching backgrounds as well. I'm looking to work through a Redux tutorial tomorrow so I can get better at understanding how it's works.

### Day 56: October 1, 2017

### Day 57: October 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Voucher App

**Thoughts:** Today I took a break from Roguelike and the Redux tutorial to build a small React app that lets me display voucher titles and descriptions. This was used as part of a present for someone in my life, but does display the rapid prototyping potential of React. Was a great break to make something small!

### Day 61: October 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Roguelike

**Thoughts:** Fixed up the actions so now the arrow keys can change which part of the map you're looking at! Definitely some big progress. I also made the stats part of the store and mapped it to the StatusBar, which worked out pretty well. Redux is feeling easier.

### Day 62: October 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Django Polls App Tutorial

**Thoughts:** I've decided to take a break from React and roguelike. My initial goal in starting this challenge and learning web development in general was to be able to learn how to actually make fully functional websites. Learning JavaScript and React has definitely let me do so on the front-end side, but I have been really wanting to do back-end things like linking to a database and forms for example. Because of this, I'm going to shift my focus towards the back-end for now. I've chosen Django simply because python is probably my best language, and it means less friction in just picking up a framework and understanding how the back-end works from a high-level perspective. Today I just worked through the polls tutorial in the docs, which is quite comprehensive and a bit confusing, but I think I'm sorta understanding how this works.

**Thoughts:** Learning more about API development with the Django REST framework. This time I actually have an api created (from a tutorial linked below). I think I understand most of it but it is somewhat complex. I'll see if I can replicate it in my own project.

### Day 67: October 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Local Library

**Thoughts:** I still feel like I'm struggling a bit with Django and overall back-end web development at the moment, so I'm working through Mozilla's tutorial to see if it makes things a lot clearer and easier for me to continue on my own. At the moment, it definitely is feeling like it will be sufficient for me to start my own projects after, which is what I'm hoping!

**Thoughts:** Did the list and detail views for books and authors. This was pretty fun to do, especially considering I had to figure out authors list and detail views based on the book views. I definitely feel much more confident in using Django now, I can see how the models, urls, templates and views all fit together much more clearly and I'm confident that once I finish this tutorial I can definitely start getting a site up and running.
