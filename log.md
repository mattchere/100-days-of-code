# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 31, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the FCC Tribute Page project

**Thoughts:** Definitely learnt a lot more about Bootstrap and just general HTML structure as well. Had some difficulties with styling but hopefully I'll get the hang of it soon!

### Day 2: August 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the FCC personal portfolio page

**Thoughts:** I'm slowly getting my head around Bootstrap and I feel way more comfortable learning from reading the docs and understanding through examples, as well as testing it out on my own web page. Looking forward to working more on this project!

### Day 3: August 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the FCC personal portfolio page

**Thoughts:** Didn't get as much time as I wanted today but I was able to implement social media links and learn a lot about plugins that extend the Bootstrap framework. I'm getting more used to Googling and finding what I need to know or use to get the result that I want as well.

### Day 4: August 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the FCC Personal Portfolio page

**Thoughts:** I spent a super long time picking colours for this webpage, and I'm not even sure I like the colour palette I picked. But I think that I'm understanding the nuances of HTML and CSS a lot more. My workflow tends to be to try something out, see how it looks and tweak until it looks right. So far it seems to be working, and I hope it continues to.
