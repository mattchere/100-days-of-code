# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 31, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the FCC Tribute Page project

**Thoughts:** Definitely learnt a lot more about Bootstrap and just general HTML structure as well. Had some difficulties with styling but hopefully I'll get the hang of it soon!

### Day 2: August 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the FCC personal portfolio page

**Thoughts:** I'm slowly getting my head around Bootstrap and I feel way more comfortable learning from reading the docs and understanding through examples, as well as testing it out on my own web page. Looking forward to working more on this project!

### Day 3: August 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the FCC personal portfolio page

**Thoughts:** Didn't get as much time as I wanted today but I was able to implement social media links and learn a lot about plugins that extend the Bootstrap framework. I'm getting more used to Googling and finding what I need to know or use to get the result that I want as well.

### Day 4: August 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the FCC Personal Portfolio page

**Thoughts:** I spent a super long time picking colours for this webpage, and I'm not even sure I like the colour palette I picked. But I think that I'm understanding the nuances of HTML and CSS a lot more. My workflow tends to be to try something out, see how it looks and tweak until it looks right. So far it seems to be working, and I hope it continues to.

### Day 5: August 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the FCC Random Quote Machine page

**Thoughts:** First time using Ajax in a project, and whilst I had some initial struggles it felt pretty natural to use. Getting a much better grasp of how JavaScript actually affects web pages in general as well. Proud of my GoT quote machine!

### Day 6: August 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on FCC Local Weather App page

**Thoughts:** Spent a lot of time reading and a bit (my daily hour) of time coding today. Read up on APIs and how keys work, and some of it was a bit overwhelming in terms of how much I still don't know, but I feel that every time I revisit a concept a little bit later I understand it a whole lot more so I'm hoping that continues for all the things I've encountered, or am yet to encounter on my journey.

### Day 7: August 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the FCC Local Weather App page

**Thoughts:** Read up (and applied) a lot of jQuery notation. I decided not to use Bootstrap for this one just to try it out without it. It required a lot more manual CSS tweaking, but I was still able to figure it out which was great. This was the most JavaScript I've written so far but it was fairly manageable.

### Day 8: August 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Wikipedia Viewer page

**Thoughts:** Didn't get as much done today, just worked on the basic template and messed around with CSS styling. I still struggle with using CSS properly and creating nice designs on the front end, but I'm working on it.

### Day 9: August 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Wikipedia Viewer page

**Thoughts:** Finished the full functionality. Learnt a lot from messing around with Wikipedia's API, much more complex than anything I've used so far. Just the styling left for tomorrow.

### Day 10: August 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Wikipedia Viewer page

**Thoughts:** Did my final styling! I honestly feel most proud of this project so far compared to all the rest. I think it's basic in styling but it looks okay and I'm really happy about that. 10% down!
