# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 31, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the FCC Tribute Page project

**Thoughts:** Definitely learnt a lot more about Bootstrap and just general HTML structure as well. Had some difficulties with styling but hopefully I'll get the hang of it soon!

### Day 2: August 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the FCC personal portfolio page

**Thoughts:** I'm slowly getting my head around Bootstrap and I feel way more comfortable learning from reading the docs and understanding through examples, as well as testing it out on my own web page. Looking forward to working more on this project!

### Day 3: August 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the FCC personal portfolio page

**Thoughts:** Didn't get as much time as I wanted today but I was able to implement social media links and learn a lot about plugins that extend the Bootstrap framework. I'm getting more used to Googling and finding what I need to know or use to get the result that I want as well.

### Day 4: August 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the FCC Personal Portfolio page

**Thoughts:** I spent a super long time picking colours for this webpage, and I'm not even sure I like the colour palette I picked. But I think that I'm understanding the nuances of HTML and CSS a lot more. My workflow tends to be to try something out, see how it looks and tweak until it looks right. So far it seems to be working, and I hope it continues to.

### Day 5: August 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the FCC Random Quote Machine page

**Thoughts:** First time using Ajax in a project, and whilst I had some initial struggles it felt pretty natural to use. Getting a much better grasp of how JavaScript actually affects web pages in general as well. Proud of my GoT quote machine!

### Day 6: August 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on FCC Local Weather App page

**Thoughts:** Spent a lot of time reading and a bit (my daily hour) of time coding today. Read up on APIs and how keys work, and some of it was a bit overwhelming in terms of how much I still don't know, but I feel that every time I revisit a concept a little bit later I understand it a whole lot more so I'm hoping that continues for all the things I've encountered, or am yet to encounter on my journey.

### Day 7: August 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the FCC Local Weather App page

**Thoughts:** Read up (and applied) a lot of jQuery notation. I decided not to use Bootstrap for this one just to try it out without it. It required a lot more manual CSS tweaking, but I was still able to figure it out which was great. This was the most JavaScript I've written so far but it was fairly manageable.

### Day 8: August 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Wikipedia Viewer page

**Thoughts:** Didn't get as much done today, just worked on the basic template and messed around with CSS styling. I still struggle with using CSS properly and creating nice designs on the front end, but I'm working on it.

### Day 9: August 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Wikipedia Viewer page

**Thoughts:** Finished the full functionality. Learnt a lot from messing around with Wikipedia's API, much more complex than anything I've used so far. Just the styling left for tomorrow.

### Day 10: August 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Wikipedia Viewer page

**Thoughts:** Did my final styling! I honestly feel most proud of this project so far compared to all the rest. I think it's basic in styling but it looks okay and I'm really happy about that. 10% down!

### Day 11: August 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Twitch Viewer page

**Thoughts:** Did all of the functionality and most of the styling for the page. Struggling a little bit with element positioning but otherwise it feels like this project wasn't too difficult, just some parsing of JSON and that's about it. I'm excited to go on to the advanced problems! I can imagine those being much harder but I feel like I'm ready for the challenge.

### Day 12: August 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Twitch Viewer page, Worked on JavaScript Calculator

**Thoughts:** Polished up my Twitch Viewer page, and I'm mostly happy with it. I started on the JavaScript calculator but spent a decent amount of time just messing around with how to position the buttons correctly on the calculator. The equals button height spanning two rows gave me a lot of problems but I eventually worked it out. The hard part starts tomorrow, with the actual calculator functionality, but I think I have some ideas.

### Day 13: August 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished JavaScript Calculator

**Thoughts:** Did a lot today and finished the JavaScript calculator! This took so long and I know my code is not particularly clean or easy to read, but I actually got it working pretty well! Had to clear out lots of bugs because of the calculator's functionality and just the sheer number of different edge cases. It took me a while but I'm proud of how it looks and how it works as well.

### Day 14: August 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Pomodoro Clock

**Thoughts:** I sped through the pomodoro clock exercise, almost implementing the whole functionality today! I have been looking forward to this particular project for a while because pomodoros have really increased my productivity ever since I began doing them 2 months ago. I really am feeling the increased knowledge of JavaScript from doing previous projects (especially the calculator). I think I'll be able to finish this tomorrow, way ahead of my initial expectations!

### Day 15: August 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Pomodoro Clock

**Thoughts:** This one was really fun. It wasn't too difficult to make and I feel I did a much better job of program structure than the last challenge (although, it is a bit spaghetti code-like I think). Next few days will be busy but I'll continue to push on through to the next project, Tic Tac Toe!

### Day 16: August 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Tic Tac Toe

**Thoughts:** Spent a while positioning elements to set the layout of this game. I don't feel that I used the best method for this task, but it works nonetheless. I haven't actually started to implement any of the real core of the game yet, mostly it has been styling it up to look good, and I'll be working on the functionality tomorrow. Hopefully there aren't too many problems but we'll see when I start it tomorrow.

### Day 17: August 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Tic Tac Toe

**Thoughts:** Spent some time making the functionality work. Ran into some problems but I think I'm almost at the point where two-player functionality is complete. Once that's done I'll be implementing the computer AI, which will hopefully be tomorrow.
